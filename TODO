The following features are to be expected in a foreseeable futur:

 * Full test suite for both dynamic errors and static errors
 * A complete set of constraints against which loaded settings can be checked
 * Loaders for json, xml, libconfig and ini files (and others depending on demands)
 * an embedded loader for a simple configuration format
